# Great-Circle-Mapper


This project utilizes a public airport data library to access all airport codes globally. Tkinter was used to make the UI and the Google Maps' Map Static API was used to display the world map as well as the airport markers and the great circle route between the airports you choose. You can include as many airports as you like. The mapped path will be between the latest airport entry and the one before it.
